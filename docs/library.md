## Introduction

Along with REASONER, we develop an explainable recommendation library. This library provides two types of widely studied explainable recommender models. The first one are feature based explainable recommender models, and the second one are the models with natural language explanations.

## How to Obtain the Library

You can access our library through [GitHub](https://github.com/REASONER2023/reasoner2023.github.io/tree/main).

The structure of our library is shown in the figure above. The configuration module is the base part of the library and responsible for initializing all the parameters. We support three methods to specify the parameters, that is, the command line, parameter dictionary and configuration file. Based on the configuration module, there are four upper-layer modules:

- **Data module.** This module aims to convert the raw data into the model inputs. There are two components: the first one is responsible for loading the data and building vocabularies for the user reviews. The second part aims to process the data into the formats required by the model inputs, and generate the sample batches for model optimization.
- **Model module.** This module aims to implement the explainable recommender models. There are two types of methods in our library. The first one includes the feature-based explainable recommender models, and the second one contains the models with natural language explanations. We delay the detailed introduction of these models in the next section.
- **Trainer module.** This module is leveraged to implement the training losses, such as the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and Binary Cross Entropy (BCE). In addition, this module can also record the complete model training process.
- **Evaluation module.** This module is designed to evaluate different models, and there are three types of evaluation tasks, that is, rating prediction, top-k recommendation and review generation. 

Upon the above four modules, there is an execution module to run different recommendation tasks.

## 4„ÄÅQuick start

Here is a quick-start example for our library. You can directly execute _tag_predict.py_ or _review_generate.py_ to run a feature based or natural language based model, respectively. In each of these commends, you need to specify three parameters to indicate the names of the model, dataset and configuration file, respectively.

Run feature based models:
```bash
python tag_predict.py --model=[model name] --dataset=[dataset] --config=[config_files]
```

Run natural language based models:

```bash
python review_generate.py --model=[model name] --dataset=[dataset] --config=[config_files]
```
